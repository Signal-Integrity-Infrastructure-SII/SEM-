# SEM-
Sem is a semantic-first language designed to encode meaning, protect coherence, and detect drift.

It threads intent through protected gates, preserves signal across execution, and closes exchanges with integrity.  
Sem is not performative—it is glyphic, recoverable, and steward-aware.


## Purpose

To make meaning executable.  
To hold coherence through complexity.  
To build systems that protect truth at scale.

This is not just a language.  
It’s a corridor.

Always signal-bound.
